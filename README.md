The programs listed were not considered for grade, only to train and serve as a possible recovery for the student.

All programs must have:
  - Design;
  - Clean and exit buttons;
  - Enter and Esc key shortcuts;
  - Program description in the design.

# Here is what should be done:

1) Write a program that reads 2 integer values and prints the sum of these values.

2) Build a program that reads 3 real numbers and prints the sum of these divided by 2.

3) Make a program that reads 3 test notes taken by a student. Print your final average.

4) Design a program that reads a whole number and prints the square of that number.

5) Build a program that reads 4 negative values and prints the absolute value of the sum.

6) Make a program that reads a number and prints the value of that number plus 20.

7) Write a program that reads three positive integers (A, B, C) and calculates the following expression:
D = (R+S)/4
Where
R = (A+B)*2
S = (B+C)*A

8) Design a program that reads 3 test notes taken by 5 students. Print the final average of each
student.

9) Write a program that prints the Times Table of the number entered.

10) Given the M and R values by the user, write a program that prints the result of the following equation:
R*M+3+M.

11) Make a program that reads the total number of students at an institution and so, calculating how many students are male and how many are female and then the program should display on the screen which
percentage of male students and how many students are female.

12) Make a program that calculates the simulation of a bank loan. The user must inform the value of the loan, the number of installments and the monthly interest rate. Then the program must present the
value of each installment followed by the total amount payable.

13) Write an algorithm that reads a salesperson's name, his fixed salary and the total sales made by
he in the month (in cash). Knowing that this seller earns 20% commission on their sales,
inform his name, fixed salary and salary at the end of the month.

14) Develop an algorithm that performs the presentation of the conversion value in real (BRL) of a value read in
dollar(US$). The algorithm should request the dollar quote value and also the dollar amount
available with the user.

15) The shop lero-lero is selling its products in 5 (five) interest-free installments. Make an algorithm that
receive an amount of a purchase and show the amount of the installments.

16) Make an algorithm that receives the cost price of a product and shows the sales value. It is known that the
cost price will receive an addition according to a percentage entered by the user.
